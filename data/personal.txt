Sophie currently lives in NE DC with her partner and long haired chihuahua Penelope! In her free time she enjoys endurance sports, pickleball, bread baking, and doggie play dates.

As an ex-athlete, Sophie has trouble sitting still and seems to always find herself in a training cycle. Her newest frontier is triathlon and she is currently preparing for the Wisconsin 70.3 Ironman this fall.
