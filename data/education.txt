Sophie Marshall graduated from the University of Wisconsin–Madison in 2022 with a Bachelor of Science in Psychology and Economics, with a Mathematical Emphasis. Her academic training reflects a strong interdisciplinary foundation in human cognition, data modeling, and statistical analysis—skills that directly support her current work in data engineering and machine learning.
While studying psychology, Sophie developed a deep interest in the mechanisms of human cognition, which naturally led her to explore fields like artificial intelligence and machine learning. Her coursework in economics, paired with a focus on mathematical modeling, helped her build a solid foundation in systems thinking, multivariate analysis, and data-driven decision-making.
During her undergraduate years, Sophie was a Division I athlete, competing as a four-year member of the Wisconsin Women’s Rowing Team, where she honed her discipline, teamwork, and resilience. She also completed an internship at Education Analytics as a Data Analyst Intern, which led to a follow-up role as an Assistant Research Analyst. In this position, she contributed to education-focused data projects, gaining early experience in applying analytics to real-world problems.
